  <h2>What is time management?</h2>
  <p>Time management refers to the ability to use your time in a manner that allows you to complete your tasks before they are due.</p>
  <p>Time management is a vital skill for any employee because it determines your ability to meet deadlines and operate productively.</p>
  <p>You can build time management skills over time through strategic systems and practices.</p>
  <h2>The four Ds of time management</h2>
  <h3>Here are the four Ds of time management to help you select and prioritize tasks:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><h3>1. Do</h3>
    <p>The first D is "do," and it stands for completing tasks that only take a few minutes to finish.</p>
    <li><h3>2. Defer</h3>
    <p>This means you can postpone tasks you don't need to complete immediately. This doesn't apply to small tasks, which fall under "do." It applies to tasks that can take up a large part of your time.</p>
    <li><h3>3. Delegate</h3>
    <p>Delegating involves sharing tasks with others if they are too many for you to complete in time.</p>
    <li><h3>4. Delete</h3>
    <p>Delete involves removing unimportant tasks from your schedule to create time for relevant ones.</p>
  </ul>
